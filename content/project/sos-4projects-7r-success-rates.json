QN SOS has a wide range of administrative data, which it is interested in using to identify and understand the needs of businesses. \n\nThe aim of this project is to identify the various factors that promote business success and prevent failure of Quinetucket businesses within the first seven years of operation. Better understanding those factors would inform intervention strategies that have the greatest likelihood of improving the success rates of Quinetucket businesses. Such information may be used by QN SOS, investors, lenders, and policymakers to support and ultimately implement these intervention strategies.\n\n",

  "statusOfData": "OSP, agency partners, and research partners work together to assess what data would advance a project, whether the data are already collected and available, and/or whether and how to collect and share it. QN SOS data reflect the agency\u2019s status as the processing and registration repository for all Quinetucket business entities created pursuant to statute \u2013 i.e., corporations and limited liability entities, not non-statutory formations such as sole proprietorships or general partnerships. These data are the most accurate and up-to-date comprehensive directory of active businesses and contact information available. The data do not include statements regarding business valuation, business purpose, or the number of employees, though such information may be available through data held by other agencies or private entities. Other data held by QN SOS reflect trademark applications, the existence (but not the value) of lien filings made pursuant to the Uniform Commercial Code, and federal tax lien filings against real property.\u00a0\n",
