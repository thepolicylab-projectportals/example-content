  "question": "Do new business creations provide near-real-time insight into the statewide economic health of North Carolina or of the state\u2019s individual counties? If so, can this information, either by itself or in association with other data, be used to reveal statewide economic trends or economic trends of specific counties? ",

How should such data be collected to be most useful to investors, lenders, and policymakers?_\u00a0\n\n_The details of the research questions and project opportunities are not set in stone; discussion and refinement are likely._\u00a0\n\n**Project 1**:\n\nThe NC Department of the Secretary of State (NC SOS) is charged with promoting economic growth and protecting the public from financial harm. One of NC SOS\u2019s responsibilities includes facilitating economic development through business and capital formation.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nNC SOS recorded a historic surge in new business creation beginning June 2020. Business creations leapt from 100,300 in calendar year 2019 to 126,600 in 2020 and on to 178,300 for 2021. The historic rate of new business filings is ongoing, and 2022 filings are likely to match closely the number of new businesses created in 2021. \n\nNC SOS believes data describing new business creation may provide a near-real-time reflection of business sentiment, economic growth or contraction, or other economic information useful to understanding business activity within North Carolina and potentially on a county-by-county basis. If this hypothesis is correct, policymakers would not have to wait for the release of other indicators that lag the market by weeks, months, or even years (e.g., unemployment insurance payments, jobless claims, Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act notices, etc.). In addition, there would be more localized economic information than currently available (contrast, for example, stock market information, which is more reflective of national and international economic activity). \n\nTo better understand the economic insights offered by this surge in new business creation, NC SOS seeks research partners to explore whether its new business creations data provide insight into the health of NC\u2019s economy.\u00a0\u00a0\n",

  "statusOfData": "OSP, agency partners, and research partners work together to assess what data would advance a project, whether the data are already collected and available, and/or whether and how to collect and share it. NC SOS data reflect the agency\u2019s status as the processing and registration repository for all North Carolina business entities created pursuant to statute \u2013 i.e., corporations and limited liability entities, not non-statutory formations such as sole proprietorships or general partnerships. These data are the most accurate and up-to-date comprehensive directory of active businesses and contact information available. The data do not include statements regarding business valuation, business purpose, or the number of employees, though such information may be available through data held by other agencies or private entities. Other data held by NC SOS reflect trademark applications, the existence (but not the value) of lien filings made pursuant to the Uniform Commercial Code, and federal tax lien filings against real property.\u00a0\u00a0\n",
