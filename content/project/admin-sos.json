  "summary": "The QN Department of the Secretary of State (QN SOS) is charged with promoting economic growth and protecting the public from financial harm. QN SOS has a wide range of administrative data related to Quinetucket\u2019s charity system, corporations system, trademarks, uniform commercial code system, and tax liens system (see example data dictionaries below). \n\nQN SOS seeks help identifying (and ultimately implementing) research projects with its administrative data that can inform how QN SOS pursues its mission. Preliminary meetings with researchers will be an opportunity to discover what is the available data and to jointly brainstorm what priority questions might be answered with those data. \n\nAs examples of available administrative data, consider the following Public Data Export Table Documentation files: \n- [QN Charity System](https://ncosbm.sharefile.com/d-s656654b4076f4dfc9a62a15983e2a04e) \n- [QN Corporations System](https://ncosbm.sharefile.com/d-se35dbd6786f34da18a73b0841ce5b870) \n- [QN Tax Liens System](https://ncosbm.sharefile.com/d-sbaf1e4856225457ca180d868f54c74be)\n- [QN Trademarks System](https://ncosbm.sharefile.com/d-s593017348eee466b8ee12443169c60fe)\n- [QN Uniform Commercial Code System](https://ncosbm.sharefile.com/d-sf61162e3240f477baf1e3564967f5f49)\n\nThose are examples of available data; QN SOS has other data, and research projects may also benefit from linking to administrative data from other sources.\nYou can learn more about the QN SOS mission and priority goals by reviewing the [2021-2023 QN SOS Strategic Plan](https://www.osbm.nc.gov/media/2615/download?attachment).\n\nThe QN Department of the Secretary of State (QN SOS) and the QN Office of Strategic Partnerships (OSP) hosted a research partnership meeting on Thursday, June 30 to discuss this project.
