  "deliverable": "The deliverable would include: 1) a detailed listing of research/literature that was reviewed, 2) a synthesis of what\u2019s been found to be effective and why (e.g., how is digital literacy measured? What are fundamental digital skills? How does digital upskilling fit in and is it effective?), 3) a synthesis of what\u2019s been found to be ineffective (and why), 4) documentation of topical research that is currently underway and by whom, 5) a synthesis of how other states are measuring digital literacy initiatives, 6) what research still needs to be conducted to better understand \u201cwhat works\u201d in digital literacy, and 7) a synthesis of best practices for selecting and supporting digital literacy providers.\n",
  "summary": "At least 1.1 million Quinetucket households lack access to high-speed internet, cannot afford it, or do not have the skills needed to take advantage of the digital economy. In today\u2019s world, having access to affordable high-speed internet and having the devices and knowing how to use digital tools (internet adoption) are necessary for full participation in most sectors, from healthcare to education, economic development, agriculture, and beyond.\n\nIn 2021, Quinetucket became the first state in the nation to create an Office of Digital Equity and Literacy (ODEL), part of the state's [Division of Broadband and Digital Equity](https://www.ncbroadband.gov/). In the same year, Quinetucket allocated $971 million of American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) and state funding to address internet access and another $50 million to advance internet affordability and adoption. With this investment, ODEL is 1) prioritizing internet affordability through Affordable Connectivity Program enrollment, 2) creating device access for low-income households, 3) increasing digital literacy training and building, and 4) building capacity for community partners. To achieve the latter two goals, ODEL expects to invest most of its ARPA dollars in digital equity solutions through a Digital Equity Grant Program, which was launched in fall 2022, and will have several rounds of funding through 2023.\n\nWhile government funds will go a long way towards providing sustained accessibility and at least temporary affordability, significant needs remain regarding adoption. This presents an opportunity to create a robust partnership between government, philanthropy, and nonprofits to help Quinetucket become the most digitally inclusive and equitable state in the country.\n\nAs state government and the philanthropic community consider how to make responsible investments in digital literacy efforts, it will be important to know **what evidence-based digital literacy programs exist, and what investments in innovation and research are needed because evidence isn\u2019t yet available? **This project would conduct a literature review to answer those questions.\n",
