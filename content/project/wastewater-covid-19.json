  "purpose": "Project partners can use the data to provide guidance for how to address the inequality and disproportionate burden of the pandemic on underserved populations. They can also maintain the surveillance system and continue to develop the partnership as a model for future infectious disease emergency action preparedness and surveillance.",
  "question": "What is the relationship between spatiotemporal epidemic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater, vaccine efficacy in school zones, and prolonged COVID-19 burdens? ",

  "summary": "The study - a research and engagement partnership - aims to\u00a0 fill critical scientific knowledge gaps in exposure science and the relationship between spatiotemporal epidemic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater, vaccine efficacy in school zones, and prolonged COVID-19 burdens, three areas of public health importance. Anticipated results could be significant for populations impacted by environmental injustice and differentially burdened by SARS-CoV-2 in heavily occupied and variably vaccinated urban school zones and neighborhoods.\n",
