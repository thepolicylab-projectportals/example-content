NC SOS does not collect data with regard to business types such as general partnerships or sole proprietorships, as there is no statutory framework associated with the formation of such businesses. Previous analyses of NC SOS registration data suggest that 25% of new business registrants cease operation by year three, and by year seven the percent of firms that cease operation increases to 50%. Additional data describing new business creation could provide a near-real-time reflection of business sentiment, economic growth or contraction, or other economic information useful to understanding business activity within North Carolina and potentially on an individual county basis.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe data currently collected do not include information regarding business valuation, business purpose, or the number of employees, though such information may be available in data held by other agencies or private entities. Because the data currently collected in connection with new business creation is comparatively limited, beginning in mid-2021, NC SOS surveyed new businesses (created between April and August 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 inclusive) to identify why these businesses were being formed and what resources and interventions respondents believed were needed to help with business success. NC SOS hoped this information would help the agency to identify interventions that might increase the likelihood such new businesses would succeed beyond three years.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nNC SOS sent the survey to 38,885 new entity creators and received 1,597 responses. The survey results are summarized in a memorandum dated December 8, 2021. The summary and underlying survey data are available upon request.\u00a0\n\nSurvey results may be used to inform targeted actions to build strategic economic development partnerships, identify short-term and long-term policy and performance management efforts, and ultimately identify areas to help these new business creators become established as quickly as possible and be as successful as possible.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nNC SOS seeks help identifying data that it might collect to better answer questions about and inform policy around new business creation, new business survival and success, and North Carolina\u2019s economic health.\u00a0\u00a0\n",

  "statusOfData": "OSP, agency partners, and research partners work together to assess what data would advance a project, whether the data are already collected and available, and/or whether and how to collect and share it. NC SOS data reflect the agency\u2019s status as the processing and registration repository for all North Carolina business entities created pursuant to statute \u2013 i.e., corporations and limited liability entities, not non-statutory formations such as sole proprietorships or general partnerships. These data are the most accurate and up-to-date comprehensive directory of active businesses and contact information available. The data do not include statements regarding business valuation, business purpose, or the number of employees, though such information may be available through data held by other agencies or private entities. Other data held by NC SOS reflect trademark applications, the existence (but not the value) of lien filings made pursuant to the Uniform Commercial Code, and federal tax lien filings against real property.\u00a0\n",
