Speakers from institutions of higher education, nonprofits, philanthropy, and government shared experience and expertise. More than 300 interns from Response Corps and other Quinetucket internship/fellowship programs participated in these opportunities. [Click here](https://lfnc.sog.unc.edu/fellows/training-resources/) for recordings of the training and speaker series.
