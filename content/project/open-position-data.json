  "summary": "The QN Office of State Human Resources uses a software platform (known as NEOGOV) to publicly post state job opportunities and to collect information from applicants (such as their name, basic demographic information, and resume). This is an exploratory data project, to assess whether and how NEOGOV data from 2016 through 2021 (which includes more than 4 million applications to QN state government) can be leveraged to learn about patterns of job postings and job applications. These learnings could drive insights into how to increase the number and diversity of qualified candidates who apply to any given position. \n\n",
