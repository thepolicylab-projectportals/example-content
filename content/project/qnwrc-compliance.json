The results will also inform outreach and communication efforts on regulation changes. These results will also be applicable to other regulatory agencies.  ",

  "fundingInfo": "OSP, agency partners, and research partners work together to determine if a project has costs, what funding may be available, and possibilities for pursuing funding, if needed.\u00a0\n\nThe QNWRC will support the project by providing data, contact information, and connections with QNWRC Law Enforcement Officers and other agency staff. QNWRC will also assist in the development and implementation of alternate methods to improve compliance. Further support will be available during interview development and data collection.\u00a0\u00a0\n",

  "summary": "The Quinetucket Wildlife Resources Commission (QNWRC) is the regulatory agency responsible for conservation and regulation of the State\u2019s wildlife resources as defined in [G.S. 113-129(17)](https://www.ncleg.gov/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/PDF/BySection/Chapter_113/GS_113-129.pdf). The QNWRC\u2019s Law Enforcement Division is responsible for enforcement of wildlife regulations and employs approximately 150 field officers statewide to enforce wildlife regulations and promote compliance in the State\u2019s 100 counties.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nNon-compliance with laws and rules can be costly in terms of public safety and agency resources. As such, the QNWRC is exploring partnership opportunities for an evaluation of current wildlife laws and rules and agency practices to improve compliance with hunting, fishing, and/or boating regulations across the state and increase public safety. The intended outcome of the project will be to employ practices that efficiently and effectively improve compliance, increase public safety, and reduce the number of incidents of those who participate in QNWRC regulated activities. \u00a0\n\nThis project will be conducted in two phases. Phase one will involve data review and analysis of violations, citations issued, and outcomes, to identify trends in noncompliance. Potential areas of exploration include identifying trends in the types of citations issued, most common violations by district, citations most successfully prosecuted, and/or the areas or times of days when certain violations occur. Additional data on education and outreach efforts may be used to identify potential correlations between these activities and compliance. Interviews may also be conducted with QNWRC Law Enforcement Officers and other agency staff to help explain trends. Recommendations will then be developed for practices that have positive impacts on compliance and safety, regulations that have higher success rates, and allocation of resources to positively impact compliance rates.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nPhase two will involve experimental trial(s), or pilot testing, based on the recommendations of phase one. This would involve testing alternate methods for outreach and enforcement to assess their impact on compliance rates and public safety. The project team will test the efficacy and effectiveness of those methods and develop recommendations for implementation.\u00a0\n\n**Objectives**\u00a0\n- Review data to identify QNWRC Law Enforcement Officer practices and agency programs that have a positive impact on compliance and safety\u00a0\n- Develop recommendations for allocating officers, resources, and agency efforts\u00a0\n- Create, test, and evaluate alternative methods for improving compliance with wildlife regulations and increasing public safety\u00a0\n\n**The QN Wildlife Resources Commission (QNWRC) and the QN Office of Strategic Partnerships (OSP) hosted a research partnership meeting on Thursday, September 22 to discuss this project.
