  "deliverable": "1. **Data collection:** Obtain information from the short-term assessment and other sources on the efficacy of various OfCM tools and their use in compliance and enforcement programs.\u00a0\n2. **Data analysis brief report**: Should include assessment(s) of the efficacy of various OfCM tools, including a determination of when/where they are the most effective relative to onsite inspections.\u00a0\n3. **Thorough synthesis report:** Using the data obtained from the analysis of the effectiveness of OfCM tools, produce a synthesis report of OfCM and the best uses of these tools. This report should include proposals to help inform policy, long-term guidance, and best practices for the use of OfCM tools.\u00a0\n\n",

How does the effectiveness of Offsite [Compliance Monitoring](https://www.epa.gov/compliance/how-we-monitor-compliance) (OfCM) activities compare to onsite inspections?\u00a0\u00a0\n    - Can OfCM identify the same violations, provide the same specific and general deterrence, and promote and maintain compliance in the same way as onsite inspections?\u00a0\u00a0\n    - What are the attributes of OfCM activities and onsite inspections required to assess their effectiveness?\u00a0\n2. What outcomes does OfCM provide?\u00a0\u00a0\n    - Does compliance depend on which monitoring\u00a0 tool is used or on whether there is OfCM activity that includes subsequent enforcement action?\u00a0\n3. Do OfCM tools support enforcement activities?\u00a0\u00a0\n    - Can evidence collected using only OfCM tools support an impactful enforcement action?\u00a0\u00a0\n    - What are the key attributes of an effective OfCM tool?\u00a0\n4. What is the best use for OfCM?\u00a0\u00a0\n    - Does it depend on the tool, the program, and/or on the compliance history of the facility?\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n**_\\*_**_The Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance (OECA) anticipates that the answers to these questions will involve multiple research efforts given the range of programs and OfCM tools that will need to be assessed. The details of the research question(s) and project opportunity are not set in stone; discussion and refinement are likely._\u00a0\n\n**Project summary:\u00a0**\u00a0\nThe Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance ([OECA](https://www.epa.gov/aboutepa/about-office-enforcement-and-compliance-assurance-oeca)) addresses pollution problems that impact American communities through provision of compliance assistance and through enforcement. OECA compliance and enforcement activities target\u202fthe most serious water, air, and chemical hazards. To enhance these efforts, the Office of Compliance is undertaking an initiative to build a national, evidence-based program designed to achieve higher levels of compliance and resulting environmental improvements through EPA\u2019s compliance and enforcement activities. This evidence-based building effort expands upon OECA\u2019s [Next Generation Compliance (\u201cNextGen\u201d)](https://www.epa.gov/compliance/next-generation-compliance) principles to embrace technology and transparency to promote compliance with environmental laws.\u202f\n\u202f\u00a0\nThe first step of this initiative is to develop a Compliance Learning Agenda (CLA), which will identify the most pressing, unanswered environmental compliance\u202fquestions and\u202festablish an evaluation plan with a series of research projects intended to answer those questions. In June 2021, OECA convened a workgroup of volunteers from US EPA, states, tribes, and academia to work together to draft the first CLA.\u202f\u202f\u00a0\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic restricted OECA\u2019s ability to do onsite inspections, which helped OECA recognize that a broader portfolio of OfCM activities may provide the office with additional tools for enforcement and compliance programs. These tools might include Desk Audits, Clean Air Act (CAA) Stack Test Reviews, Information Request Response Reviews, among others. To assess what the office learned from the extended use of OfCM over the past two years and gain insight into the efficacy of OfCM tools relative to onsite inspections, OECA conducted a preliminary, short-term assessment of US EPA\u2019s use of OfCM using readily available data and information to inform interim guidance and best practices. OECA now seeks to use those results to guide a longer-term assessment and research into OfCM and the best uses of these tools moving forward. OECA anticipates that the answers to these questions will involve multiple research efforts given the range of programs and OfCM tools that will need to be assessed.\u00a0\n\n**Key\u00a0Acronyms**:\n\n**US EPA: **Environmental Protection Agency\u00a0\n**OECA: **Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance\u00a0\n**OfCM:** Offsite Compliance Monitoring\u00a0\n**CLA:** Compliance Learning Agenda\u00a0\n**OSP:** Quinetucket Office of Strategic Partnerships\u00a0\n\nThe QN Office of Strategic Partnerships develops, launches, and enhances partnerships between state government and Quinetucket\u2019s research and philanthropic sectors.
