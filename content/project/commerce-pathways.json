  "summary": "The [NCWorks Commission](https://www.nccommerce.com/about-us/boards-commissions/ncworks-commission) at the [NC Department of Commerce](https://www.nccommerce.com/) is exploring research partnership opportunities to better understand the relevance and utility of the [NCWorks Certified Career Pathways](https://www.nccommerce.com/jobs-training/workforce-professionals-tools-resources/workforce-plans-initiatives/ncworks-certified) (CCP) program. The 41 CCPs, managed by 22 local workforce development boards across North Carolina, are  systems of education and workforce development programs that aim to match worker training to employer need as well as encourage and incentivize employers to locate and expand in North Carolina.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe goal of this project is to collect qualitative and quantitative data from CCP administrative leaders and former participants, and answer questions including, but not limited to:\u00a0\u00a0\n1. How many job seekers participated in each CCP?\u00a0\u00a0\n2. How many job seekers completed at least one credential in the CCP, and what credential(s) did they receive?\u00a0\n3. Are any of the credentials received by job seekers non-degree and high value, and are they  on the NC Workforce Credentials high value credential list?\u00a0\n4. Did enrolling in the Career Pathway program impact employee retention for CCP industries and if so, how?\n\nThe NC Department of Commerce and the NC Office of Strategic Partnerships (OSP) hosted a research partnership meeting on Friday, September 9 to discuss this project.

  "statusOfData": "There is administrative data for the years 2010 to 2020 that capture, at the individual level, which courses a person has taken, when and where the course was administered, which program the course is a part of, and whether or not the individual successfully completed the course. These data would need to be wrangled and cleaned for research purposes. A preliminary review suggests records exist for about 3,000 individuals. We welcome suggestions for other sources of data that might be merged with these data to empower more insights into the research questions above.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n",
